    <h2>
      The X - A Brief History
    </h2>
    <p>
      The X is the brainchild of three friends who liked to party together on their trips in the UNLV Marching Band. Dylan, Carson, and Max had a vision; the best afterparties around when it comes to UNLV football, with all their friends, all the vibes, and conveniently located right next to UNLV's campus. While Carson and Dylan came up with the name, it was known that Max's townhouse across Maryland Parkway would be the ideal location for these future legendary parties. This idea, first sprouted in Summer of 2024, would finally grow its legs after a tumultuous 2024-25 school year and begin its life with the Fall 2025 semester and Rebel Football kickoff.
