      <tr>
        <th scope="row">1.</th>
        <td>Why is it called 'The X' anyways?</td>
        <td>'The X,' though commonly misconstrued as a reference to the movie "Project X," is actually named that because it comes after the W (from UNLV Football).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">2.</th>
        <td>When should I show up to The X?</td>
        <td>About an hour and a half after the end of UNLV Football is a good time to arrive. This is roughly 6 hours after a scheduled football start time.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">3.</th>
        <td>Do I have to pay to get in?</td>
        <td>Partygoers unless otherwise told by the host are expected to pay a $5 cover fee to cover drinks, food, and games. Bringing supplies is also sufficient for a cover.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">4.</th>
        <td>How long does The X usually last?</td>
        <td>The X will tend to go anywhere from 1:00 to 3:00AM, depending on the start time.</td>

      <tr>
        <th scope="row">5.</th>
        <td>What if I can't get home safe?</td>
        <td>Safe rides are able to be arranged by the host, there is also limited availability for overnight stays.</td>

        <th scope="row">6.</th>
        <td>Do I have to be invited to The X? Can I bring friends?</td>

      <tr>
        <th scope="row">7.</th>
        <td>What happens if UNLV Football loses?</td>
        <td>The party must go on. That night's party will therefore be known as "The M" (it comes after the L).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">8.</th>
        <td>How many people are at a typical X?</td>
        <td>Capacity for The X is around 50 people, and is usually met or a bit under.</td>
